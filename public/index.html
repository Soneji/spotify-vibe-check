      <p>Some info on the app:</p>
      <p>Spotify vibe checker was created with the official Spotify API and generates statistics about the nature of
        your playlists. The characteristics generated are shown below</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Average Playlist Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic
          tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low
          on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness,
          timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</li>
        <li>Average Playlist Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of
          musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</li>
        <li>Average Playlist Vibes – Tracks with high vibes sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while
          tracks with low vibes sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed,angry).</li>
      </ul>
